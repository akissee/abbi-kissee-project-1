Project 1

For my project I will to do a deep dive into MongoDb/Mongoose and I will also utilize some NodeJS Express as well. I hope to create a blog website where the user can see previous article/blog postings sorted by most recent - oldest. They can see the articles on the home page, then when they click the 'Add New' they are taken to another page where they can enter a Title for the article, description of the article, and a body of the article using Markdown. Then once they click 'Save' they are taken back to the home page where the new article is now listed at the top of the articles list. Alternatively, they can click the 'Cancel' button and be redirected back to the home page. There will also be 'Full Article', 'Edit', and 'Delete' buttons underneath each article on the homepage where the user can view the full article, edit the article, or delete the article from the list on the home page.
